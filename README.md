# Pokedux

I started this project with the main goal to learn more about the awesome [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) architecture.

After watching the egghead series [Getting started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)
by [@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov), I felt like I need some project kind of "real word" to put my hands on.

All this pokemon data I got from [pokeapi](http://pokeapi.co) thanks to [@phalt](http://twitter.com/phalt_).

## Install
